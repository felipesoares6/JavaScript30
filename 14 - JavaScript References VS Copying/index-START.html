    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();

    }

    // and think we make a copy:
    const felipe = person;
    // felipeson.number = 99;

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
